    st.write('I was watching the live coverage of the UEFA Euro 2020 when the Danish-playmaker Christian Eriksen collapsed on the pitch due to a sudden cardiac arrest. It was a thought-provoking incident for me. I started pondering on the health and fitness routines of sports athletes. When I researched further, I realised that it is not just sports athletes, but millions of people dying of sudden cardiac arrest every year. While it is often underreported, sudden cardiac arrest is a health risk and has to be prevented wherever possible. Thus, through this website, I aim to raise awareness about the importance of Automated External defibrillators (AED), heart screening,  and the need for education and training on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).')
